Goal: Create a stunning, high-performance portfolio website for a GenAI Full Stack Engineer.

Design Aesthetic:

Theme: Modern, Futuristic, and Clean. Dark mode preferred (deep grays/blacks with neon purple or blue accents to signify AI/Tech).

Typography: Monospace fonts for headers (like standard code editors) and clean sans-serif for body text.

Vibe: Professional but cutting-edge. Use glassmorphism effects for project cards.
